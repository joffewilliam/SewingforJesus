Title of card: Making dresses for girls and sharing love through sewing

Started by Bev Breece, Sewing for Jesus meets on Mondays from 10:30 AM – 2:30 PM at Evangel Baptist Church in Taylor, Michigan. We sew dresses & skirts for needy children around the world as well as here in the States, pack them into Operation Christmas Child shoe boxes, and ship them to many countries.

We also welcome trading items so everyone can pack shoe boxes and bless children everywhere. All of us share the same purpose and plan God has led us to: to show God's love in a very special way.

Meeting location: Evangel Baptist Church — 16994 Telegraph Rd, Taylor, MI 48180
